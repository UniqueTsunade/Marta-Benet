      I’m a Spanish artisan, designer and architect based in Italy. My work is
      based on the application of craftsmanship in objects and spaces design
      with a contemporary approach.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Influenced by the Mediterranean traditions and culture of my hometown –
      Valencia – my work develops around ceramics and textiles. Each creation is
      the result of the union between design and craftsmanship and emphasizes
      the beauty of handmade things and their imperfections.
